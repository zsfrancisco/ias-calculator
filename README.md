# IAS Calculator
It's an application to calculate hours worked for any person, depending of the hours of the day, weekends and night, I did it to pass a programming challenge for the company [IAS](https://www.ias.com.co/en_US/), it was really amazing, you can calculate your salary depending your hours worked.

Note: I did it first in GitLab, that's the reason why there's only one branch, you can see the original repo here [GitLab repository - IAS Calculator - Francisco Zambrano](https://gitlab.com/ias-calculator)

I applied the better practices that I know.
